# BabyDataApp
Parents of infants have the ever-important job of ensuring their little one is nourished and cared for around the clock. When a baby's erratic sleep schedule is considered, keeping track of important baby statistics such as diaper changes and feedings becomes difficult. And when the little one inevitably gets sick, keeping track of baby’s intakes and outputs, as well as medicine administered, helps parents monitor their baby’s condition and adjust care as needed. 

Traditionally, these statistics might be documented on a notebook or notepad, but these pages can get lost, destroyed, and are hard to read at 3AM when your baby won’t sleep. BabyDataApp provides a quick and convenient web user interface that allows parents to track their little one. Paper and pen can be retired in favor of the parents’ cell phones for ease of use. BabyDataApp tracks information such as the dates and times of wet diapers, dirty diapers, medicine used, fluids/feedings ingested, and any general notes that might go with one of these aspects (super fussy at diaper change, for example).
